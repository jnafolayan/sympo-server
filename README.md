# Sympo
Sympo is just another pet project of mine that supposedly fosters online polls. Start polls and see votes updating in near real-time.
You can find the front-end repo for this project [here](https://github.com/jnafolayan/sympo-ui).

# Technology
The backend code was written to run on Node.js. Uses sockets for real-time poll monitoring, and MongoDB (through Mongoose) for storage.

# Live 
The server is hosted on Heroku at https://sympo-server.herokuapp.com
